<p><strong>We call them "representatives" because</strong>  members of the House are elected to represent the interests of their constituents back home. But how representative are they really?</p>
<p>My colleague at techPresident, Micah Sifry, <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/23341/one-person-one-vote-some-members-congress-are-3x-representative-others">suggests</a> that one measure of how much clout a member of Congress could be said to have is how many of the voters in their district actually took the positive step of voting to send that member to D.C. Given that all congressional districts are roughly the same — there are some variations, but in general, they are supposed to have about 700,000 people in them — he came up with a rough metric, "representative quotient." This is the number of voters that sent a member of Congress to the Capitol, divided by 700,000.</p>
<p>Some people have actually talked respectable news outlets into measuring members of Congress by how many Twitter followers they have. If that passes for a way to rank lawmakers, then no matter how simplistic "representative quotient" is, it qualifies, too.</p>
<p>But what does that actually look like? Experts told Micah that Republicans are more efficiently distributed than Democrats — that given the predations of redistricting and the dynamics of party strategy, a Republican is likely to go to Congress with fewer votes than a Democrat. Micah was also told that given this, and given that Democrats tend to be from tightly-packed urban districts, you'd see a higher RQ in the North and in metropolitan areas than you'd see in the South or in rural areas.</p>
<p>A little statistical analysis bears this out. Democrats generally win with more votes than Republicans do, and Democrats' vote totals are far more varied than Republicans', according to my analysis of Dave Wasserman's data.</p>
<p>Using QGIS, TileMill, Leaflet and Wax, I've built a map of the country showing the RQ for each member of Congress so you can decide for yourself. Non-voting members — from D.C., Puerto Rico, and the territories — are omitted.</p>
